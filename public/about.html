<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Veronica Chitwood and I'm a aspiring software developer.  I was born and raised and still live in a 
  small town, Bay City, TX.  It is 25 miles from Matagorda beach.  I'm married to husband for 11 years now and we 
  have one daughter together and own our own house.

<p>I first became interested in software development when I realized I had an opportunity to go to school 
  and that was one of the concentrations.  I realized very quickly that this area interested me immensely.  Previously,
  I had fancied myself a writer, I had been able to that successfully for a few years, and then mysteriously lost 
  the ability.  I realized software dev was a way I could still create and be artistic in just a different way.  
  That was when I realized it was what I wanted to do.
